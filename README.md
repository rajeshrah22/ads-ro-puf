For Project 1 of Advanced Digital Systems Design, we create a Physically Un-cloneable Function (PUF) with Ring Oscillators on the Max 10 FPGA.

A PUF is essentially a Random Number Generator that relies on variations in silicon processes due to nano-scale imperfections for its source of natural randomness.
