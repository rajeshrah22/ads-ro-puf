For Project 1 of Advanced Digital Systems Design, we create a Physically Un-cloneable Function (PUF) with Ring Oscillators on the Max 10 FPGA.

A PUF is essentially a Random Number Generator that relies on variations in silicon processes due to nano-scale imperfections for its source of natural randomness.

Hardware Description is written in VHDL 1993, and synthesized for Max 10 using Intel Quartus Prime.
Ring Oscillator circuit simulations are written in ngpsice and simulated using `ngspice`.
